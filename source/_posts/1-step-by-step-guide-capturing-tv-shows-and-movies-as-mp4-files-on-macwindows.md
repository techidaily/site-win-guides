## 1. Step-by-Step Guide: Capturing TV Shows & Movies as MP4 Files on Mac/Windows

### Overview

When users need to record TV programs, DVR, PVR or other digital recording devices come to their mind. These recording devices can provide flexibility and convenience for users to watch the TV programs at their free time. And also these recording devices will skip the ads when recording to offer users a ad-free environment for watching TV program. But one big drawback for these recording devices is that there is storage limitation. And to avoid losing your previously recorded TV programs, most of users will transfer the recorded TV programs to other devices for archive or playback. Here comes a trouble with the video transferring, that is, the recorded TV program can not be played on the device due to the video format incompatibility. To solve the video incompatibility, users need another software for their TV format conversion.

* Allavsoft is just the software. With Allavsoft, users only need to import their recorded TV program to Allavsoft, and convert the recorded TV program to their needed video format.
* Another advantage of choosing Allavsoft is that like the digital recording devices, Allavsoft can directly work as a TV program recorder to help users to record the TV program, including the live TV program.
* Allavsoft can record any movie, any type of video, any live conference, webinar, Skype calls, WeChat calls, any screen activity as well as the TV program without ads or virus.
* Allavsoft is built with a video converter which can help to convert any recorded video to your needed video format. More surprising, actually Allavsoft is also a advanced video downloader supporting to download videos from 10,000+ video websites.
