 Share this tutorial:

##  Introduction 

 Mirillis Action! provides powerful and easy to use features that allow you to create great video guides. You can create a video guide or a tutorial about anything you can do on your PC and add your voice over and special effects to make it look more appealing for your audience. 

 With an exceptionally high frame rate, Action! can help you create true HD quality and smooth videos. You can easily add commentary with your microphone to create fantastic video guides. With just a click you can export your video guides to YouTube or Facebook.

 You can even add a video from your webcam, add commentary to that with microphone and combine everything into one great HD video guide. 

 Action! supports a wide variety of high resolution and high definition video recording modes. Starting from 240p, through 720p and 1080p up to to 4k / ULTRAHD video recordings. 

 To create video guides, you can use two different recording modes: fullscreen recording mode or selected desktop region recording mode.
