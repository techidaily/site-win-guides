## Ultimate Guide: Converting Online Audio Streams Into High-Quality MP3 Files

### Overview

There are a bunch of audio websites for users to entertain themselves. But there are some users who may think enjoying audios online is not the only thing they want, they also want to transfer the audio to their friends, listen to the audio on their iPhone, iPad, iPod, Android, etc, edit the audio on some audio editing program, etc, to achieve one of which, they need to save the audio locally. Well, there are two popular methods for users to save audios locally from the internet. One is to download online audio and the other is to record the online audio. Downloading online audios with the audio URL is simpler than recording online audios if you use a professional audio recorder.
